***Actionable Insights:***
- Communicate to the marketing team to create a discount coupon for bike products to get market interest & increase the revenue in any branch, due to the past revenue data in Australia.
- Discuss the previous customer behavior to get the most valuable user to apply the discount in each branch.
- Discuss with the marketing team to create a perfect bundle product that suits market and campaign needs.
